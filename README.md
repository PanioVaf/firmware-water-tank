The content is divided into three parts.

1. The theoretical part analyzes the specifications and requirements
for the overall system.
2. The implementation part, presents the collection and the assembly
of the hardware system.
3. Finally the programming part, where the programming of an
Arduino platform in C++ language is presented, for the cooperation with an ultrasonic sensor
